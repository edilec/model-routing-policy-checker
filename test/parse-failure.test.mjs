/**
 * The JSON parse-failure helper.
 *
 * V8 embeds the offending input in its own error message, so interpolating
 * `error.message` walks a document onto stdout and stderr past every redactor.
 * A pricing snapshot is exactly the kind of file that sits next to an API key
 * in somebody's configuration directory, and truncation does not help: the
 * quoted copy is at the front, and the quoted window can be taken from the
 * middle of a long document.
 *
 * The case that matters most is `at position 1`. A helper that looks for the
 * offset before recognising the quoting shape finds that phrase INSIDE the
 * quoted span and slices the document straight back out. Nineteen of
 * thirty-eight tools in this catalog shipped that bug; every group that wrote
 * this test found it.
